This is an example python package set up for distribution with
distutils.

See http://docs.python.org/distutils/index.html

Some common commands:

 * 'python setup.py install' Install package.

 * 'python setup.py sdist' Create a source distribution.

Some notes:

* The MANIFEST.in file only seems to be needed if you want to override
  the creation of MANIFEST by setup.py.
