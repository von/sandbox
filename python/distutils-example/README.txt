This is an example python package set up for distribution with
setuptools (a more powerful version of distutils).

See https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html

Some common commands:

 * './setup.py install' Install package.

 * './setup.py sdist' Create a source distribution.

 * './setup.py develop' Install linked for development (not in distutils).

Some notes:

* The MANIFEST.in file only seems to be needed if you want to override
  the creation of MANIFEST by setup.py.
